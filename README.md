# Web 3 tutorial from FEM ðŸ’ª

This is an awesome [web3 course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web3-smart-contracts/) that I took from Frontend Masters.

It utilized `solidity` & `hardhat`, and gained exposure to creating smart
contracts, utilizing metamask (pre-hackðŸ˜‰), running a local node (server/chain), and writing some tests for smart contracts.

It was a lot of fun!
